/*
JavaScript provides various types of loops:

   游대 The for loop iterates through a code block a specific number of times.
   游대 The for/of loop iterates through the values of an iterable object.
   游대 The for/in loop iterates through the properties of an object.
   游대 The while loop continues to iterate through a code block as long as a given condition remains true.
   游대 The do /while loop also iterates through a code block as long as a specified condition remains true,
         but it guarantees the execution of the block at least once before checking the condition.
